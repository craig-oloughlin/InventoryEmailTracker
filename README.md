About this script...

I learned a little bit of Python code from a book (I believe Head First Programming) and decided I can try to apply this knowledge to a problem I faced in my work environment. The goal was to automate the process of checking for out of calibration equipment from our master list of equipment so that we may be reminded to send for calibration.

Although the code works, there is some doubt if 'best practice' was used. I am hoping to be able to revisit this after obtaining a CS degree and see how it holds up.
